                <h2>Personal and Professional Goals</h2>
                <p>Professional: <br><br>I'm currently studying Computer Science at Unifal and I'm also studying Web Development. I still haven't decided which area of computing I want to work in, but I continue my daily studies to learn the fundamentals and basis 
                    of computing to use them in my professional life. My goal is to work for some Big Tech, mainly Google.</p>
                <p>Personal: <br><br>My main dream is to have a family and be able to travel a lot around the world. My goal is to be able to make 3 annual trips, because traveling is something I love and value, because I believe that the only thing that will always 
                    walk with us are the memories and experiences we had in life.</p>

                <p>The sport I am passionate about is basketball. I love both playing and watching. If I had the time, 
                    I would play every day without fail, because I feel immense happiness playing.</p>
                <br class="space"> 
                <p>I like to watch the NBA, I'm a Lakers fan and I have Kobe Bryant as an idol. Unfortunately, 
                    I didn't saw him play much as I'm relatively new to the basketball world, but I admired his mentality, play style and focus he had on and off the court.</p>
                <br class="space"> 
                <p>I also like soccer a lot, but nothing compares to how much I love basketball. My football idol is Lionel Messi, 
                    who made me feel pleasure watching every minute of his matches in which he always made absurd moves.</p>
