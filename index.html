                <h2>Personal and Professional Goals</h2>
                <p>Professional: <br><br>I'm currently studying Computer Science at Unifal and I'm also studying Web Development. I still haven't decided which area of computing I want to work in, but I continue my daily studies to learn the fundamentals and basis 
                    of computing to use them in my professional life. My goal is to work for some Big Tech, mainly Google.</p>
                <p>Personal: <br><br>My main dream is to have a family and be able to travel a lot around the world. My goal is to be able to make 3 annual trips, because traveling is something I love and value, because I believe that the only thing that will always 
                    walk with us are the memories and experiences we had in life.</p>
